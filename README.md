Forces and moments acting on the beams

Simlple application calculating turning moments acting on the beam and drawing accurate graph. It can also calculate and draw graph of tangential forces. You can add forces by inserting its intensity, distance from the affirmation and spread. You have to also insert diameters of the beam by choosing where it ends and what is its size.
